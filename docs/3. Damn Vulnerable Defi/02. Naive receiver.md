## Goal

Take all ETH out of the userâ€™s (FlashLoanReceiver) contract in a single transaction.

## Exploit

In order to finish this CTF we will have to use another smart contract. We can name this contract Attacker.

The vulnerable part of the code is located in the NaiveReceiverLenderPool contract, inside the flashLoan() function.

Instead of relying on the balance of ether (address(this).balance) inside the NaiveReceiverLenderPool contract, we rely on an arbitrary amount of ETH, that can be set on function call, as a balance to be transferred to the borrower contract (FlashLoanReceiver).

This way we can call the flashLoan() function with 0 as amount, and after calculating the fee and after the loan has been settled, this will leave the borrower with 1 eth less. Repeating this operation for 10 times will leave the borrower with 0 ether.

In order to do this in one transaction we can create Attacker contract, and call the flashLoan() function from NaiveReceiverLenderPool in a for loop 10 times.

To exploit the contract we need to:

1. create Attacker contract, and create instances from the NaiveReceiverLenderPool and FlashLoanReceiver contracts inside the Attacker contract
2. in the constructor of the Attacker contract, in a for loop, call the flashLoan() function from NaiveReceiverLenderPool contract, set FlashLoanReceiver as borrower and set amount to be 0.
