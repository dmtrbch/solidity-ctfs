## Goal

To pass this challenge, we must take all DVT tokens from the vault (```ClimberVault``` contract).

## Exploit

In the CTF againg we are dealing with upgradeable proxies. The ```ClimberVault``` is ```UUPSUpgradeable``` proxy, which means there is a proxy contract at the front, and whenever we are interacting with the vault, a call is made to the proxy contract which then delegates call to the ```ClimberVault``` contract.

When ```ClimberVault``` contract is deployed, we can see that it's ```initialize``` function is called, and inside this function, among other things, the ownership to this contract is transferred to a newly instantiated ```ClimberTimelock``` contract.

In order to exploit the ```ClimberVault```, we need to find a way to upgrade the proxy to point to a different version of the vault, and inside this new version we should set the malicious contract as the ```_sweeper``` and sweep all the funds from the vault.

To do this we can make use of the ```ClimberTimelock``` contract.

After inspecting the code inside ```ClimberTimelock```, we can see that the purpose of this contract is to ```schedule``` and ```execute``` transactions on a time basis. Since this contract is the owner of ```ClimberVault```, we can try to ```schedule``` and ```execute``` transactions that will trigger functions from this contract.

The reason ```ClimberTimelock``` is vulnerable to attack is beacuse the check
```
if (getOperationState(id) != OperationState.ReadyForExecution) {
  revert NotReadyForExecution(id);
}
```

if this check was before line 88, it would not have been possible to expolit this CTF.
This way ```ClimberTimelock``` violates the ```checks-effects-interactions``` and enables a ```reentrancy attack```.

The sequence of steps we need to take in order to abuse ```ClimberTimelock``` is the following:

1. create AttackerVault contract, this contract will be identical to ClimberVault, with only difference one difference, we will make _setSweeper function inside it to be public
2. prepare the necessary data in our ```ClimberAttacker``` contract that will be used as a function parameters to call ```execute``` function from ```ClimberTimelock```. This data will consists the following:
  <ul>
  <li>array of addresses called targets, first and second items will hold the address of ClimberTimelock, third and fourth items will hold the address of ClimberVault, fifts items will hold the value of the ClimberAttacker contract</li>
  <li>array of uints called values, they should be 0 so no need to assign anything to them</li>
  <li>array of bytes called dataElements, first item will hold the value of the abi encoded function signature of grantRole function (this will be used to set the ClimberAttacker to have the PROPOSER_ROLE in order for ClimberAttacker contract to be able to schedule transactions inside ClimberTimelock); second item will hold the value of the abi encoded function signature of updateDelay (this will be used to update the delay inside ClimberTimelock to 0, so we don't have to wait 1 hour to execute a scheduled transaction); third item will hold the value of the abi encoded function signature of upgradeTo (this will update the vault (ClimberVault) proxy to point to the newly created malicious contract AttackerVault which will be the new update version of the vault); fourth item will hold the value of the abi encoded function signature of _setSweeper (inside the new version of the vault, we will set _setSweepet to be public so anyone can call it and we will set the sweeper of the vault to be the ClimberAttacker contract); fifth item will hold the value of the abi encoded function signature of makeSchedule function (we will add this function inside ClimberAttacker contract, it will be a callback function that ClimberTimelock contract will call after executing the last transaction sent to execute function)</li>
3. create attack function, inside this function we will call execute from ClimberTimelock with the previously prepared data, after the call has finished we will call sweepFunds() function from ClimberAttacker to sweep the funds from the vault
4. create makeSchedule function, inside this function we will call schedule from ClimberTimelock with the previously prepared data, this is a callback function that will be triggered after the last transction from execute is called
