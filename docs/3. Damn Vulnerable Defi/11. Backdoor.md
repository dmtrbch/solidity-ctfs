## Goal

Our goal is to take all funds (DVT) from the registry (```WalletRegistry``` contract). In a single transaction.

## Exploit

To incentivize the creation of more secure wallets in their team, someone has deployed a registry of Gnosis Safe wallets. When someone in the team deploys and registers a wallet, they will earn 10 DVT tokens.

In order to be able to exploit the ```WalletRegistry``` we must be familiar with Gnosis Safe wallets, and how they function.

Gnosis Safe is a multisignature wallets, whicch imlemented thorugh a smart contract that is deployed on the blockchain. It's most commonly used to require more owners of a particular Gnosis Safe to approve that a specific transaction can be submitted on the blockchain.

Additionaly, Gnosis Safe allows you to add modules to it, extending it's functionalities. Behind the scenes, Gnosis Safe is a specific type of proxy contract, we have a Gnosis Safe Proxy Factory Contract, and the job of this factory contract is to deploy new Gnosis Safe wallets.

By following the proxy upgradability it allows all created Gnosis Safes to use one logic contract (```GnosisSafe```), while delegating calls to it. In particular every single Gnosis Safe is actually a proxy, that will ```delegatecall``` to the implementation which is the ```GnosisSafe``` contract.

The way it works is, we have the factory deployed (```GnosisSafeProxyFactory```), and a single veriosn of the wallet (```GnosisSafe```), this is what's known as the Singleton Pattern, later on the factory will deploy a proxy and any call to that proxy will be delegated to ```GnosisSafe```.

Let's get back to our CTF.

We are given the ```WalletRegistry``` contract, inside this contract we have the ```beneficiaries``` mapping pre-populated. Whenever an account inside ```beneficiaries``` decides to create a Gnosis Safe, this account will receive 10 DVT tokens.

The way ```WalletRegistry``` keeps track whether a benificary has created a Gnosis Safe is with the help of ```proxyCreated``` function.

Whenever a Gnosis Safe is created via ```GnosisSafeProxyFactory::createProxyWithCallback``` function, ```proxyCreated``` will be triggered, and inside this function multiple checks will be performed and if every requirement is fullfilled, 10 DVT tokens will be send to the beneficiary wallet.

However, there is a critical assumption in these checks. The assumption is that the owner of the safe is the same person that created the safe. This is not a safe assumption!

First, let's explore what exactly is being called when these safes are deployed.

The ```GnosisSafeProxyFactory::createProxyWithCallback``` function allows us to pass arbitrary code as an initializer for the new safe. But as required in the checks noted above, this initializer must be a call to ```GnosisSafe::setup```.

Since we can pass anything we want to this ```setup``` function, there's an opportunity for an exploit.

The ```to``` and ```data``` parameters are used to execute arbitrary code as the safe, as soon as the safe is created. We can pass an ERC-20 ```approve``` call as the data parameter to grant our attack smart contract address full access to the safe's DVT tokens!

In order to fit the attack into one transaction, we'll need to instantiate a single-use callback smart contract to pass as the ```to``` parameter during the attack. Inside the callback contract should be a wrapper function that calls the ERC-20 ```approve``` function.

In this CTF by extending the Gnosis Safe with additional module (```setupModules``` function from ```ModuleManager``` contract) we can add our ```Attacker``` contract as module.

In order for this attack to be prevented, inside the ```WalletRegistry``` we must check that the creator (initiator) of the Gnosis Safe is indeed one of the beneficiaries that are previously set.

To exploit the contract we need to:

1. create ```DVTStealerModule``` contract, inside this contract we will create a function that will approve the ```BackdoorAttacker``` contract to transfer all the DVT tokens from the GnosisSafe to our account (this is the single-use callback contract)
2. create ```BackdoorAttacker``` contract, and pass the following parameters to the ```constructor```:
  <ul>
  <li>address of the GnosisSafeProxyFactory</li>
  <li>address of the GnosisSafe</li>
  <li>address of the WalletRegistry</li>
  <li>addresses of the beneficiaries</li>
  <li>DVT token address</li>
  </ul>
3. inside the constructor we will:
  <ul>
  <li>instantiate new DVTStealerModule contract</li>
  <li>use a for loop to go through the list of all beneficiaries, and in every iteration we will: prepare the data for the initializer parameter that we need to send to GnosisSafeProxyFactory::createProxyWithCallback; create new GnosisSafe proxy (behind the scenes this proxy will delegatecall to the DVTStealerModule approving the DVTStealerModule contract to spend the DVT tokens on its behalf); transfer the DVT tokens from the GnosisSafe proxy to ourselves</li>
  </ul>
