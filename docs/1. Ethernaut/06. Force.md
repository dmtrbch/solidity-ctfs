## Goal

We need to find a way to send ETH to the Force contract

## Exploit

In order for a smart contract to be able to receive ETH it should have fallback() and/or receive functions implemented.

As we can see our Force smart contract is empty so it seems it is not possible to send ETH to it, or maybe it is :).
Let's find out.

Every smart contract in Solidity can call a special function called selfdestruct. What this function does is deleting the contract from the blockchain and sending all remaining ETH stored in the contract to a designated address. More info can be found <a href="https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.19/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html#deactivate-and-self-destruct" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

So, how can we make use of selfdestruct to solve the CTF. We can create another smart contract (Attacker), call the selfdestruct function on the Attacker contract, and set the address of the Force contract as a designated target for sending the ETH

The steps to reproduce the exploit would be:

1. create Attacker contract, and create instance from the Force contract inside the Attacker contract
2. the constructor of the Attacker smart contract should be payable in order to be able to receive ETH while instantiating contract (we will send this ETH on contract creation)
3. create external destruct() function inside Attacker contract, this function will call selfedstruct with the Force address as parameter
4. call the destruct() function

## Attacker contract code

```
contract Attacker {

  address private forceContractAddress;

  // send 1 ETH to the contract on creation
  constructor(address _force) payable {
    forceContractAddress = _force;
  }

  function destruct() external {
    selfdestruct(forceContractAddress);
  }
}
```
