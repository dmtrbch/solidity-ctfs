## Goal

The goal of this level is to claim ownership of the Preservation instance.

## Exploit

In order to finish this CTF we will have to use another smart contract. We can name this contract Attacker.

This contract utilizes a library to store two different times for two different timezones. The constructor creates two instances of the library for each time to be stored.

The first issue that arises is related to the ```LibraryContract``` if this contract was defined as library instead of contract, we would not have been able to exploit this contract, because ```library``` keyword prevents the libraries from storing and accessing state variables.

When using ```delegatecall``` we must have in mind that the storage layout is very important, therefore the order of the state variables in the caller and the callee should be consistent and same.

If we take a closer look we can see that when we call ```setFirstTime``` or ```setSecondTime``` from ```Preservation```, we delegatecall to the ```LibraryContract```.
To be more specific, it means we will call ```setTime``` function inside ```LibraryContract``` and update ```storedTime``` variable to the value passed in ```setTime``` function. When we write to ```storedTime``` variable we are writing to the first slot reserved for ```LibraryContract```, but since we are using ```delegatecall``` this will update the first slot of ```Preservation``` contract and it will update the ```timeZone1Library``` variable of the contract, and we want this variable to hold the value of our ```Attacker``` contract address.

It means we need to figure out how to call ```setFristTime``` with the desired input, and that would be the uint256 value of our ```Attacker``` contract address. To do that we need to cast the address to uint256.

After calling ```setFirstTime``` for the first time, we can call it once again inside our ```Attacker``` contract but since ```timeZone1Library``` is already updated to hold the value of the ```Attacker``` contract address, it will delegatecall to it, calling the ```setTime``` function. This means we need to have a ```setTime``` function in our ```Attacker``` contract. Inside ```setTime``` we will update the value of the ```owner``` variable, and this will update the ```owner``` variable in the ```Preservation``` contract.

One thing to note is that the ```Attacker``` contract should have the same storage layout as the ```Preservation``` contract.

To exploit the contract we need to:

1. create Attacker contract
2. create attack(Preservation preservation) external function inside the Attacker contract, passing in the Preservation contract as function argument, and inside this function we will:
  <ul>
  <li>call setFristTime function from the Preservation contract and pass the uint256 value representation of the Attacker contract address as argument, this will update timeZone1Library variable inside Preservation to the Attacker contract address</li>
  <li>call setFristTime again, this will call cause the Preservation contract to delegatecall to the Attacker contract by calling setTime inside the Attacker contract</li>
  <li>check if the owner variable inside Preservation is the same as msg.sender, otherwise revert</li>
  </ul>
3. add setTime function, inside this function we will update the owner of the Preservation contract by assigning a value to the owner state variable of the Attacker contract

One question that bugs me, is why this solution won't work if we omit the require statement inside the ```attack``` function!?

## Attacker contract code

```
contract Attacker {
    address public timeZone1Library;
    address public timeZone2Library;
    address public owner; 
    uint storedTime;

    function attack(Preservation preservation) external {
        preservation.setFirstTime(uint256(uint160(address(this)))); //set the value of timeZone1Library to address(this)
        preservation.setFirstTime(uint256(uint160(msg.sender))); // call setFristTime from preservation again to execute setTime inside this contract
        require(preservation.owner() == msg.sender, "hack failed");
    }

    function setTime(uint _time) public {
        owner = address(uint160(_time));
    }    
}
```
