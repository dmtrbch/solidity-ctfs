## Goal

The goal of this level is to claim ownership of the Delegation instance.

## Exploit

In order to exploit this contract one must first understand how ```fallback``` methods and ```delegatecall``` low function works.

```fallback``` is a special function that is executed when a function that does not exist is called from some smart contract.

```delegatecall``` is a low level function similar to call, with the only difference when we make a delegatecall to some smart contract, the callee's smart contract code is executed in context of the caller (this means the caller storage is changed, and msg.sender and msg.value from the caller are taken into account).

In our case, when we try to call the ```pwn()``` function inside ```Delegation``` contract, since this function is not present in the ```Delegation``` contract, its ```fallback``` function will be triggered and it will delegatecall to the ```Delegate``` contract with the ```pwn()``` function funcion-selector argument for msg.data.

To exploit the contract we need to:

1. copy the code from Ethernaut to Remix
2. get the contract instance address from the web console
3. load the ```Delegate.sol``` contract at the contract instance address (it is important to load ```Delegate.sol``` contract and not ```Delegation.sol```)
4. call the ```pwn()``` function inside Remix. NOTE: we need to increase gas limit in MetaMask in order for the transaction to succeed
