## Goal

The goal of this ctf is to hijack the ```PuzzleWallet``` by becoming admin of the ```PuzzleProxy```.

## Exploit

In order to finish this CTF we will have to use another smart contract. We can name this contract Attacker.

This contract utilizes a library to store two different times for two different timezones. The constructor creates two instances of the library for each time to be stored.

```PuzzleWallet``` is an upgradeable contract which is following the Proxy Upgrade Pattern pattern and can be upgraded by calling the ```upgradeTo``` function from ```PuzzleProxy```.

When dealing with upgradeable proxies one must be aware that the storage layout of the proxy contract and the implementation (logic) contract must be the same, and this is where we can start looking for possible exploits.

If we compare the storage variables in ```PuzzleProxy``` (proxy contract) and ```PuzzleWallet``` (implementation contract) we can notice that ```pendingAdmin``` variable inside ```PuzzleProxy``` corresponds to ```owner``` inside ```PuzzleWallet``` and ```admin``` variable corresponds to ```maxBalance```. This means if we can find a way to update ```maxBalance``` variable we can update the admin of ```PuzzleProxy```.

After digging into the ```PuzzleWallet``` contract we can notice that the only way to update ```maxBalance``` is through the ```setMaxBalance``` function, however there are two requirements that we need to satisfy, first one is we need to be whitelisted, second one is the balance of ether in the ```PuzzleWalet``` should be equal to 0.

Let's start with passing the first one. In order to get whitelisted we need to call ```addToWhitelist``` function inside ```PuzzleWallet```, but there is additional requirement here, the caller of ```addToWhitelist``` must be the ```owner```. Remember when we said that ```owner``` state variable corresponds to ```pendingAdmin``` variable, this means if we find a way to update the ```pendingAdmin``` variable, beacause of the nature of Proxy Upgrade Pattern and ```delegatecall```, ```owner``` variable will also get updated and we can set the ```Attacker``` contract as the ```owner```. To update ```pendingAdmin```, we will call ```proposeNewAdmin``` function inside ```PuzzleProxy```, this will update ```owner``` inside ```PuzzleWallet```, and therefore we can call ```addToWhitelist``` and add the ```Attacker``` contract address in the ```whitelisted``` mapping.

It means we are now whitelisted and our next task is to find a way how to drain the ETH balance from ```PuzzleWallet```.

The only function that is sending ETH away from ```PuzleWallet``` is ```execute```, but in order to call this function successfully we must have first deposited ETH in ```PuzzleWallet```, the contract is tracking this using the ```balances``` mapping. Given that this contract already has a balance of 0.001 ETH locked in it (we can check this by loading the ```PuzzleWallet``` contract at address inside Remix, we can find this address in the Ethernaut console), we must fund a way to depoist 0.001 ETH but update the ```balances``` mapping to show as if we have deposited 0.002 (after depositing 0.001 ETH, ```PuzzleWallet``` contract balance will become 0.002 ETH, and we must take all of this ETH from the contract).

Something that we must have in mind is that when using ```delegatecall```, msg.value and msg.sender are context preserving, meaning they will have the same value as in the caller contract.

In order to do so, we will make use of the ```deposit``` & ```multicall``` functions. First we can see that inside ```multicall``` we can pass a bytes array ```data``` which is later used when ```delegatecall``` low level call is performed inside ```multicall```. When ```performing``` a ```delegatecall``` we can notice that the ```PuzzleWallet``` contract is actually calling "iteslf":

```(bool success, ) = address(this).delegatecall(data[i]);```

What we can do is prepare the ```data``` argument, in a way that when we call ```multicall```, the first parameter from the ```data``` array will cause a ```delegatecall``` to the ```deposit``` function of the same (```PuzzleWallet```) contract , and the second paramter from the ```data``` array will cause a ```delegatecall``` to the ```multicall``` function which will then call the ```deposit``` function inside ```PuzzleWallet``` (we must ```delegatecall``` to ```multicall``` frist and to ```deposit``` directly because of the following check: ```if (selector == this.deposit.selector)```).

After passing the two requirements at the end we are only left to call ```setMaxBalance``` function from ```PuzzleWallet``` and send the uint256 representation of our EOA address ```uint256(uint160(someAddress))``` as a function parameter.

To exploit the contract we need to:

1. create IPuzzleWallet interface and define all the functions that we are going to use from ```PuzzleProxy``` & ```PuzzleWallet```
2. create Attacker contract, passing the IPuzzleWallet interface object as a constructor parameter
3. inside the constructor of the ```Attacker``` contract we will:
  <ul>
  <li>call proposeNewAdmin() function from PuzzleProxy passing the address of the Attacker contract as an argument for the _newAdmin parameter</li>
  <li>call addToWhitelist() function from PuzzleWallet passing the address of the Attacker contract as an argument for the addr parameter</li>
  <li>prepare the data array that we will need to pass to the multicall function</li>
  <li>call multicall() function from PuzzleWallet passing the previously prepared data array as an argument for the data parameter and send 0.001 ETH as a value</li>
  <li>call execute() function from PuzzleWallet passing the address of the Attacker contract as an argument for the to parameter, 0.002 ETH as argument for the value parameter and empty string as argument for the data parameter</li>
  <li>call setMaxBalance() function from PuzzleWallet passing the uint256 representation of our EOA address</li>
  <li>check if the admin of PuzzleProxy contract is set to our account address</li>
  </ul>
