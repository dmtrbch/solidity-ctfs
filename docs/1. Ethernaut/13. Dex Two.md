## Goal

Drain all balances of token1 and token2 from the DexTwo contract.

## Exploit

The exploitable part of the code is located in the swap function,
the issue is that we don't check if the from and to address are equal to token1 and token2 address correspondently.

To exploit the contract we need to:

1. create new two new tokens (ex. TKN3, TKN4) that will be instances from SwappableTokenTwo
2. both of these tokens should have total supply of 200 tokens, all of which will be minted to our account address
3. we will approve the DexTwo contract to be able to spend 100 TKN3 tokens on our behalf
4. we will transfer 100 TKN3 tokens to DexTwo contract
5. we will call swap() function from DexTwo contract with the following arguments:
  <ul>
  <li>TKN3 address will be used as argument for from parameter</li>
  <li>TKN1 address will be used as argument for to parameter</li>
  <li>the amount that we will send will be 100 TKN3 tokens (100000000000000000000)</li>
  </ul>
6. we will approve the DexTwo contract to be able to spend 100 TKN4 tokens on our behalf
7. we will transfer 100 TKN4 tokens to DexTwo contract
8. we will call swap() function from DexTwo contract with the following arguments:
