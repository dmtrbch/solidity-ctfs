# Welcome!

The blockchain field develops at an incredibly fast pace. This course will give you a solid foundation of blockchain principles. It will also introduce you to the tools used to build blockchain projects today. It can be overwhelming to enter such a rapidly developing field and we hope to give you the mental model to incorporate new information as it comes in.

## Course content

In this course, I start off by teaching you about the underpinnings of the blockchain and show how it all comes together to allow us to build the next generation of web applications.

We will start with an overview of what we call blockchain primitives: The technology brought together underneath the name blockchain. We'll then dive deeper into the specifics of the Ethereum protocol and learn how those blockchain primitives show up there. 

Next, we'll move on to understanding how to write smart contracts. I introduce you to Solidity, a programming language for Smart Contracts that lets you interact with the Ethereum Virtual Machine. We'll learn about Truffle so you can try out your new Solidity skills! We'll also discuss smart contract design patterns and security for your smart contracts.

After that, we'll introduce you to developer tooling, including Web3 libraries, and other development frameworks. 

Last, we'll discuss the way in which people are innovating blockchain development, with an introduction to Decentralized Finance (DeFi). While this material may seem a bit overwhelming, it's important to have it available to you as you continue to develop in the space. You can always come back later to reread stuff. And I won't be testing you on it :)

So without further ado, I wish you the best of luck, and letâ€™s get started!
